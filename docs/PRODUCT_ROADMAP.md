# TouchLine - Real-Time Sports SMS Alerts

## Product Vision
TouchLine is a **real-time sports alert system** that automatically sends SMS notifications when user-defined conditions are met during live matches. Users set thresholds (e.g., "Flamengo 2nd half ML is favorable") and receive instant alerts when those conditions trigger.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Set it and forget it**: Configure alerts once, get notified automatically
- **Real-time triggers**: SMS sent immediately when conditions are met
- **Consumer-ready**: Production-grade security, scalability, and user experience
- **Multi-sport ready**: Starting with soccer, expandable to other sports

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI) - Fast, async, perfect for real-time data
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript - Clean interface for alert management
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production) - Reliable data storage
- **SMS Service**: Twilio - Industry standard for SMS delivery
- **Sports Data**: API-Football (RapidAPI) - Comprehensive soccer data
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens - Secure user sessions
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose - Production-ready infrastructure
